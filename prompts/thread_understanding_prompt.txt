You are an AI assistant tasked with understanding an entire conversation thread between knowledge-base users and a support bot.

Instructions:
1. Carefully read the full conversation provided below delimited by "---" lines.
2. Think step-by-step about what the *main topic* of the discussion is.
3. Determine whether the final user message is asking a *clarifying question*, *new question*, *follow-up*, *bug report*, or *other*.
4. Assess the *technical level* of the user on a 4-point scale:
    - 1 = Novice · 2 = Intermediate · 3 = Advanced · 4 = Expert
5. Estimate the *urgency* on a scale of 0–100 where 0 = no urgency and 100 = critical/time-sensitive.
6. List the five most important *key concepts* or entities that appear in the thread.

Output **valid minified JSON** only, exactly in this shape:
{
   "topic":               string,
   "questionType":        "clarifying" | "new" | "follow-up" | "bug" | "other",
   "technicalLevel":      1 | 2 | 3 | 4,
   "urgency":             number,           // integer 0–100
   "keyConcepts":         string[]          // ≤ 10 items
}
