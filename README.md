# Knowledge Capture Bot for Google Chat

Capture human corrections and additions surfaced in Google Chat threads so your documentation never falls behind.

This Google Apps Scriptâ€“powered Chat bot lets support and engineering teams quickly save valuable context when an AI assistant gives an incomplete or wrong answer. The `/capture-knowledge` slash-command extracts the full thread, identifies what the AI said versus what humans corrected, and writes any gaps to a Google Sheet for later documentation updates.

## ðŸ‘‰ Project Purpose

- **Surface missing or outdated docs** â€“ every human correction is treated as a documentation gap.
- **Keep context where the conversation happened** â€“ invoke a single slash-command, no copy-paste.
- **Built entirely with Google Apps Script** â€“ zero servers to run or bills to pay.

## MVP Feature List

- `/capture-knowledge` slash-command
- Thread extraction (messages + metadata)
- Storage in Google Sheets (one row per captured thread)
- Identification of AI- vs human-authored messages

## Setup Instructions (local dev)

1. Clone repo â†’ `git clone https://github.com/jon-neher/AppScript-Chat-Knowledge.git && cd AppScript-Chat-Knowledge`
2. Install clasp + deps â†’ `npm install -g @google/clasp && npm install`
3. `clasp login`
4. `clasp create --type standalone --title "Knowledge Capture Bot"` then copy the Script ID into `.clasp.json`
5. Create a Google Sheet and put its ID in `src/SheetsManager.js` (`const SHEET_ID = '...'`)
6. `clasp push` to deploy.

## Usage

Type `/capture-knowledge` in any Chat thread. The bot confirms and stores the thread in Sheets.

## Architecture

| Layer            | Responsibility                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Chat App  | Receives slash-commands and routes events to Apps Script |
| Apps Script      | Parses thread and writes data to Sheets                  |
| Google Sheets    | Lightweight review queue / knowledge base               |

## Development commands

- `clasp push` â€“ deploy code
- `clasp pull` â€“ sync down latest script
- `clasp logs` â€“ view execution logs

# AppScript Chat Knowledge Bot

This repository contains the source code and configuration for a Google Apps Script powered Google Chat bot that helps teams surface and manage knowledge right inside Chat.

The project uses the [Google clasp CLI](https://github.com/google/clasp) for local development and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js â‰¥ 18
- Google Apps Script access with permission to create a project
- Google Cloud project with Chat API enabled (for production deployments)
- `npm install -g @google/clasp` (or use the local version via `npm run`)

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Login to Google** (creates a local `.clasprc.json` *not* committed to Git):

   ```bash
   npm run login
   ```

3. **Push local code to the Apps Script project**

   ```bash
   npm run push
   ```

4. **Open the Apps Script editor in your browser**

   ```bash
   npm run open
   ```

## Connecting to the shared script

This repository is already wired up to the *team-shared* Google Apps Script project. The real `scriptId` lives in the root-level `.clasp.json` file and is version-controlled, so you donâ€™t need to copy it around or set any environment variables.

Typical first-time workflow:

1. `npm install` â€“ install dependencies (including the local `@google/clasp` binary)
2. `npm run login` â€“ open a browser window so clasp can authorize your Google account and write the token to `~/.clasprc.json`
3. `npm run push` â€“ upload the contents of `src/` to the shared script

After that you can iterate with the usual `push` / `pull` / `open` commands as documented below.

## NPM scripts

| Script  | Purpose                             |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| `login` | Authenticate clasp with your Google account |
| `push`  | Upload the contents of `src/` to the linked Apps Script project |
| `pull`  | Download the latest project files into `src/` |
| `deploy`| Create/override a deployment for the web app (used by the Chat bot) |
| `open`  | Open the project in the browser |

## Project layout

- `src/` â€“ All Apps Script `.gs` (and plain `.js`) files plus the `appsscript.json` manifest.
- `docs/` â€“ Additional project documentation.

## Manifest highlights (`src/appsscript.json`)

- Uses the modern **V8** runtime.
- Declares the OAuth scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.bot` required for Chat bots.
- Configured as a **web app** so the published URL can be added to Google Chat.

## Configuration Options

All configuration now lives in a single file: `src/Config.gs`. Edit the
constants in that file and push with `clasp push`â€”no JSON, YAML, or
environment variables required.

| Key | Type | Required | Constraints |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| DOCUMENTATION_BASE_URL | string (URL) | âœ… | Must start with `http://` or `https://`. |
| PAGE_ANALYSIS_LIMIT | integer | âœ… | 1 â‰¤ value â‰¤ 1000 |
| LLM_PROVIDER | `'openai' \| 'gemini'` | âœ… | â€” |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | string | conditional | Required when `LLM_PROVIDER === 'openai'`. |
| GEMINI_API_KEY | string | conditional | Required when `LLM_PROVIDER === 'gemini'`. |
| OPENAI_ENDPOINT | `'chat' \| 'responses'` | optional | Defaults to `'chat'`. `'responses'` routes all requests to the OpenAI **Responses** v1 endpoint instead of Chat Completions. |
| OPENAI_MODEL_ID | string | optional | Defaults to `'gpt-3.5-turbo'`. |
| GEMINI_MODEL_ID | string | optional | Defaults to `'gemini-pro'`. |
| RESPONSES_BETA | boolean | optional | Include `OpenAI-Beta: responses=v1` header when using responses endpoint. Defaults to `false`. |

Validation runs at **load-time**â€”a bad value throws an Error before the bot can
process any Chat events. Because configuration is checked synchronously there
is no need for network reachability tests or external file parsing.


### Quick-start: Switch to the OpenAI *Responses* API

If you want every LLM call to hit the brand-new [Responses v1 endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/create) simply tweak two keys in `src/Config.gs`:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  // â€¦existing required keysâ€¦

  OPENAI_ENDPOINT: 'responses', // route traffic to /v1/responses
  RESPONSES_BETA: true,        // add the required beta header (only while the endpoint is in beta)
};
```

No code changes are necessaryâ€”`sendThreadForUnderstanding()` will automatically
convert the chat history into a single prompt string and call the new
endpoint.


## TypeScript & esbuild build pipeline (2025-07)

The Apps Script portion of the repo is now written in **TypeScript** and bundled
with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) into a single `bundle.gs` file. The
workflow is completely driven by npm scripts:

| Script | What it does |
| ------ | ------------ |
| `npm run build`  | Executes esbuild (`build/esbuild.config.js`) then copies an updated manifest to `dist/`. |
| `npm run watch`  | Same as build but starts esbuild in **watch** mode for sub-100 ms incremental rebuilds. |
| `npm run deploy` | Runs the build and immediately `clasp push --rootDir dist`, ensuring only the bundled output is uploaded. |

The `appsscript.json` manifest in `dist/` automatically sets:

```json
{
  "rootDir": "dist",
  "filePushOrder": ["bundle.gs", "appsscript.json"]
}
```

so that Googleâ€™s clasp tool uploads your code first, followed by the manifest.

> **Heads-up**: The original `.gs` files have been migrated to TypeScript under
> `src/server/`. Tests now import the configuration through
> `src/config/nodeConfig.js`, so `npm test` still works out-of-the-box.
