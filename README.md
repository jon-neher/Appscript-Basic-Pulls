# Knowledge Capture Bot for Google Chat

Capture human corrections and additions surfaced in Google Chat threads so your documentation never falls behind.

This Google Apps Script–powered Chat bot lets support and engineering teams quickly save valuable context when an AI assistant gives an incomplete or wrong answer. The `/capture-knowledge` slash-command extracts the full thread, identifies what the AI said versus what humans corrected, and writes any gaps to a Google Sheet for later documentation updates.

## 👉 Project Purpose

- **Surface missing or outdated docs** – every human correction is treated as a documentation gap.
- **Keep context where the conversation happened** – invoke a single slash-command, no copy-paste.
- **Built entirely with Google Apps Script** – zero servers to run or bills to pay.

## MVP Feature List

- `/capture-knowledge` slash-command
- Thread extraction (messages + metadata)
- Storage in Google Sheets (one row per captured thread)
- Identification of AI- vs human-authored messages

## Setup Instructions (local dev)

1. Clone repo → `git clone https://github.com/jon-neher/AppScript-Chat-Knowledge.git && cd AppScript-Chat-Knowledge`
2. Install clasp + deps → `npm install -g @google/clasp && npm install`
3. `clasp login`
4. `clasp create --type standalone --title "Knowledge Capture Bot"` then copy the Script ID into `.clasp.json`
5. Create a Google Sheet and put its ID in `src/SheetsManager.js` (`const SHEET_ID = '...'`)
6. `clasp push` to deploy.

## Usage

Type `/capture-knowledge` in any Chat thread. The bot confirms and stores the thread in Sheets.

## Architecture

| Layer            | Responsibility                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Chat App  | Receives slash-commands and routes events to Apps Script |
| Apps Script      | Parses thread and writes data to Sheets                  |
| Google Sheets    | Lightweight review queue / knowledge base               |

## Development commands

- `clasp push` – deploy code
- `clasp pull` – sync down latest script
- `clasp logs` – view execution logs

# AppScript Chat Knowledge Bot

This repository contains the source code and configuration for a Google Apps Script powered Google Chat bot that helps teams surface and manage knowledge right inside Chat.

The project uses the [Google clasp CLI](https://github.com/google/clasp) for local development and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- Google Apps Script access with permission to create a project
- Google Cloud project with Chat API enabled (for production deployments)
- `npm install -g @google/clasp` (or use the local version via `npm run`)

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Login to Google** (creates a local `.clasprc.json` *not* committed to Git):

   ```bash
   npm run login
   ```

3. **Push local code to the Apps Script project**

   ```bash
   npm run push
   ```

4. **Open the Apps Script editor in your browser**

   ```bash
   npm run open
   ```

## Connecting to the shared script

This repository is already wired up to the *team-shared* Google Apps Script project. The real `scriptId` lives in the root-level `.clasp.json` file and is version-controlled, so you don’t need to copy it around or set any environment variables.

Typical first-time workflow:

1. `npm install` – install dependencies (including the local `@google/clasp` binary)
2. `npm run login` – open a browser window so clasp can authorize your Google account and write the token to `~/.clasprc.json`
3. `npm run push` – upload the contents of `src/` to the shared script

After that you can iterate with the usual `push` / `pull` / `open` commands as documented below.

## NPM scripts

| Script  | Purpose                             |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| `login` | Authenticate clasp with your Google account |
| `push`  | Upload the contents of `src/` to the linked Apps Script project |
| `pull`  | Download the latest project files into `src/` |
| `deploy`| Create/override a deployment for the web app (used by the Chat bot) |
| `open`  | Open the project in the browser |

## Project layout

- `src/` – All Apps Script `.gs` (and plain `.js`) files plus the `appsscript.json` manifest.
- `docs/` – Additional project documentation.

## Manifest highlights (`src/appsscript.json`)

- Uses the modern **V8** runtime.
- Declares the OAuth scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.bot` required for Chat bots.
- Configured as a **web app** so the published URL can be added to Google Chat.

## Configuration Options

All configuration now lives in a single file: `src/Config.gs`. Edit the
constants in that file and push with `clasp push`—no JSON, YAML, or
environment variables required.

| Key | Type | Required | Constraints |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| DOCUMENTATION_BASE_URL | string (URL) | ✅ | Must start with `http://` or `https://`. |
| PAGE_ANALYSIS_LIMIT | integer | ✅ | 1 ≤ value ≤ 1000 |
| LLM_PROVIDER | `'openai' \| 'gemini'` | ✅ | — |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | string | conditional | Required when `LLM_PROVIDER === 'openai'`. |
| GEMINI_API_KEY | string | conditional | Required when `LLM_PROVIDER === 'gemini'`. |
| OPENAI_ENDPOINT | `'chat' \| 'responses'` | optional | Defaults to `'chat'`. `'responses'` routes all requests to the OpenAI **Responses** v1 endpoint instead of Chat Completions. |
| OPENAI_MODEL_ID | string | optional | Defaults to `'gpt-3.5-turbo'`. |
| GEMINI_MODEL_ID | string | optional | Defaults to `'gemini-pro'`. |
| RESPONSES_BETA | boolean | optional | Include `OpenAI-Beta: responses=v1` header when using responses endpoint. Defaults to `false`. |

Validation runs at **load-time**—a bad value throws an Error before the bot can
process any Chat events. Because configuration is checked synchronously there
is no need for network reachability tests or external file parsing.


### Quick-start: Switch to the OpenAI *Responses* API

If you want every LLM call to hit the brand-new [Responses v1 endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/create) simply tweak two keys in `src/Config.gs`:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  // …existing required keys…

  OPENAI_ENDPOINT: 'responses', // route traffic to /v1/responses
  RESPONSES_BETA: true,        // add the required beta header (only while the endpoint is in beta)
};
```

No code changes are necessary—`sendThreadForUnderstanding()` will automatically
convert the chat history into a single prompt string and call the new
endpoint.


## TypeScript & esbuild build pipeline (2025-07)

The Apps Script portion of the repo is now written in **TypeScript** and bundled
with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) into a single `bundle.gs` file. The
workflow is completely driven by npm scripts:

| Script | What it does |
| ------ | ------------ |
| `npm run build`  | Executes esbuild (`build/esbuild.config.js`) then copies an updated manifest to `dist/`. |
| `npm run watch`  | Same as build but starts esbuild in **watch** mode for sub-100 ms incremental rebuilds. |
| `npm run deploy` | Runs the build and immediately `clasp push --rootDir dist`, ensuring only the bundled output is uploaded. |

The `appsscript.json` manifest in `dist/` automatically sets:

```json
{
  "rootDir": "dist",
  "filePushOrder": ["bundle.gs", "appsscript.json"]
}
```

so that Google’s clasp tool uploads your code first, followed by the manifest.

> **Heads-up**: The original `.gs` files have been migrated to TypeScript under
> `src/server/`. Tests now import the configuration through
> `src/config/nodeConfig.js`, so `npm test` still works out-of-the-box.
