# Knowledge Capture Bot for Google Chat

Capture human corrections and additions surfaced in Google Chat threads so your documentation never falls behind.

This Google Apps Scriptâ€“powered Chat bot lets support and engineering teams quickly save valuable context when an AI assistant gives an incomplete or wrong answer. The `/capture-knowledge` slash-command extracts the full thread, identifies what the AI said versus what humans corrected, and writes any gaps to a Google Sheet for later documentation updates.

## ðŸ‘‰ Project Purpose

- **Surface missing or outdated docs** â€“ every human correction is treated as a documentation gap.
- **Keep context where the conversation happened** â€“ invoke a single slash-command, no copy-paste.
- **Built entirely with Google Apps Script** â€“ zero servers to run or bills to pay.

## MVP Feature List

- `/capture-knowledge` slash-command
- Thread extraction (messages + metadata)
- Storage in Google Sheets (one row per captured thread)
- Identification of AI- vs human-authored messages

## Setup Instructions (local dev)

1. Clone repo â†’ `git clone https://github.com/jon-neher/AppScript-Chat-Knowledge.git && cd AppScript-Chat-Knowledge`
2. Install clasp + deps â†’ `npm install -g @google/clasp && npm install`
3. `clasp login`
4. `clasp create --type standalone --title "Knowledge Capture Bot"` then copy the Script ID into `.clasp.json`
5. Create a Google Sheet and put its ID in `src/SheetsManager.js` (`const SHEET_ID = '...'`)
6. `clasp push` to deploy.

## Usage

Type `/capture-knowledge` in any Chat thread. The bot confirms and stores the thread in Sheets.
